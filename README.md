With this simple script you can pick up the address with the necessary symbols
run terminal in address.js file directory, then type:

npm i ethers

npm i crypto

node address

Use only 0..9, a, b, c, d, e, f symbols. 

Write your characters on line 23 and run the script. 

Note that each additional character increases search time by 16 times.

This is very low-productive, if you need to find more than 6 symbols, you can use https://github.com/johguse/profanity
